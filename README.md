# Code Quiz Challenge

## Overview

The objective is to make a code quiz that tests your knowledge on some web develop concepts.

## My goals are to...

* Make all the buttons functional
* Remove seconds from the timer if a question is wrong
* Save score and name of the player at the end of the quiz
* Allow the user to retake the quiz
* Get more confortable with Dom

## How did I prepare? 

Here are some of my initial sketches that helped me get an idea of how I wanted the quiz to look and get me some ideas on how to update each buttons content.
